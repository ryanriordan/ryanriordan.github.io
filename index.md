This is Ryan Riordan's Academic Website. You can find me at the Queen's School of Business.

I am an assistant professor of finance at the Queen's School of Business, Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. My research is in the area of financial markets, and market microstructure. Recently I have been focussing on the impact of high frequency trading on market liquidity and efficiency.
